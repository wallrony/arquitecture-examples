# Arquitecture Examples

Yo! that Repo contains some examples of each layer used to structure a frontend web application and it's layers following some SOLID and clean code approaches, so have fun with it :D!

# Summary

Currently I pushed examples for the [API](./api/) and [Service](./service/) layers. In some days I'll push some examples of the Context and UI layers, so keep updated for new commits ;).

# How to run?

Before you run any application inside of any folder, you need to run our mock backend following the steps below:

1. Install all needed dependencies executing `npm install` or `yarn`;
2. Run `npx json-server backend.json --port 3333 --delay 1000` or `yarn json-server backend.json --port 3333 --delay 1000` to run our mock backend.

And voala! Feel free to run any example of any layer folder (keep attention to have the server online during testing the example codes).
